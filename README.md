# Java-Projects
This repository contains projects completed by me that illustrates my Java experience. These projects are meant to be run in the IntelliJ IDE. I am responsible for the full creation of all these projects, with the exception of the "Cell" class in MazeMaker.

## Projects
### Interactive-Formulas:
A simple program that allows a user to interact with their terminal and solves formulas for the user based on user input

### Wordle:
Takes the user through a fully functional game of Wordle via the terminal. A user guesses a 5 letter word picked by the program at random, and is informed of which letters are correctly placed, which letters are in the program chosen word but not in the correct position, and which letters are not in the program chosen word. The user has six guesses to find the secret word.

### Dictionary-Accessor:
The user can input words and definitions into this program by file i/o or manually through terminal interaction. The user can then access the words and corresponding definitions input into the program in various ways.

### Make-Maker
The user inputs dimensions of a maze into the terminal, and a maze of those dimension is printed in response. The program can also solve the given maze per user request.

### Data-Prediciton
The program recieves a csv with recordings of windspeed of an area and performs ordinary least squares regression to create a best fit line that can be used to predict wind probabilities based on windspeed. The program then outputs data visualization based on data read in.
